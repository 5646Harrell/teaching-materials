# JS for the Web: Making webpages interactive (Self-paced)

Slides and materials are hosted [on Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/html-css-js).

## Course description

Want to make your webpages interactive? Then you'll need to use JavaScript, the language of the web.
In this workshop, you'll learn how to use JavaScript with webpages - starting with using it to manipulate the HTML/CSS on a page, then attaching events to respond to user interaction, and finally, animating parts of your page.

This workshop will be largely "self-paced". That means that we'll start with a round of introductions and an overview, and then you'll watch videos and do coding challenges at your own pace, using [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/html-css-js). We will stop to work on pair projects every few hours, and we'll have TAs to answer questions and help when you get stuck.

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML/CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). That means that you either attended our HTML 101 workshop and JS 101 workshop, or that you learned those concepts online. 

You can review them online at a few places:
* HTML/CSS: [Khan Academy's HTML/CSS course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css), [Codecademy's HTML/CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web), [GDI SF HTML/CSS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/htmlcss-1day)
* JS: [Codecademy's JS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript), [Khan Academy's Intro to JS course](https://khanacademy.org/programming),  [GDI SF JS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/javascript)

### Tech requirements:

* Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay) and charger.
* A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox. 
* A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (free; available for both Mac and PC) or Notepad++ (PC).

### Topics covered:

* JS DOM access
* JS DOM manipulation
* JS DOM events
* JS DOM animation
