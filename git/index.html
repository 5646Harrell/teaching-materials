            <li><span class="green">Distributed!</span> Everyone has her own local copy.</li>
            <li><span class="green">Scalable!</span> Enables potentially thousands (millions!) of developers to work on single project.
            <li><span class="green">Local!</span> You don't need a network connection to use it. You only need a remote server if you want to share your code with others (e.g., using GitHub).</li>
            <li><span class="green">Branches!</span> Keep your coding experiments separate from code that is already working.</li>
            <li>Everyone has a local copy of the <span class="green">shared files</span> and the <span class="green">history.</span></li>
