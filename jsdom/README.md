# JS DOM Review

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/jsdom).

## Course description

You know how to write a JavaScript function, and you also understand HTML and CSS. But do you remember how to put the two together? In this workshop, you'll review how JavaScript interacts with the DOM (Document Object Model). We will talk about DOM traversal, as well as review events and callbacks. 

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs, and will be taught by [teacher X, tiny bio]. This is a great follow-up workshop for those who have attended our JS for the Web workshop.

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML/CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). Attendees should also have learned the DOM API (access and modication methods). That means that you either attended our HTML 101 workshop, JS 101 workshop, and JS for the Web workshop, or that you learned those concepts online. 

You can review them online at a few places:
* HTML/CSS: [Khan Academy's HTML/CSS course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css), [Codecademy's HTML/CSS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web), [GDI SF HTML/CSS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/htmlcss-1day)
* JS: [Codecademy's JS course](https://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript), [Khan Academy's Intro to JS course](https://khanacademy.org/programming),  [GDI SF JS slides](http://teaching-materials.org/javascript)
* DOM API: [Khan Academy's "Making Webpages Interactive" course](https://khanacademy.org/html-css-js)

### Tech requirements:

* Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay) and charger.
* A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox. 
* A text editor. We recommend [Sublime Text 2](www.sublimetext.com/2), (free; available for both Mac and PC) or Notepad++ (PC).

### Topics covered:

* JS DOM traversal
* JS DOM events / callbacks
* DOM coding best practices
