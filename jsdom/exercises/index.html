      <p>Go through these steps, and do as many as you can in the time we have:</p>
      <ol>
        
      </ol>

	<p>Make sure that you use your browser developer tools to make debugging easier
while working on this. Check for errors, and use console.log() to figure out
how far your code makes it, and what the values of your variables are along the way.</p>

<p>Your task is to create a Froyo machine! Use starter.html to get started.</p>
<p>There is a power button, and 3 other buttons on the machine already. When a uses presses the power button, the 'click' event will fire for that element. Create an event handler for the button that binds an event to the other buttons on the machine.</p>
<p>Each button on the machine should do something. Use the included Froyo images to create and append an &lt;img&gt; tag, and the append it to the conveyor belt &lt;div&gt; on the side of the machine.</p>
