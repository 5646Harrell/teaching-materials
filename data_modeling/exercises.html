    	<p class="lead">Exercises to help explain how Data Modeling works!</p>

        <h3 id="exercise1">Modeling Places</h3>
        <p>In this exercise, you'll model two places for storage in a reviews website like Yelp, Google Local, or Foursquare.</p>
        <p>We're not terribly worried about format for this. <strong>PAIR UP</strong> and try to use JSON - but don't worry so much about getting it exactly right. 
        If you get stuck trying to read something you wrote, here's a <a href="http://json.parser.online.fr/">JSON Parser</a> that will organize things for you.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, create a new file - call it places.json</li>
            <li>Start with an array with two or more objects - <code>[{}, {}, {}]</code></li>
            <li>We're going to model places from this list, or choose your own favorite places!</li>
            <li>Ask yourself these questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>What properties do each of these places have? An address? A name?</li>
                    <li>How are they different?</li>
                    <li>What makes them different <em>in the same way?</em> (like type: grocery store, or pub, or coffee shop)</li>
                    <li>What information is useful, vs not useful? (phone numbers are useful, but number of bricks isn't. Unless you are building a national brick database.)</li>
                    <li>What is someone looking for when they look up information about this thing? What am <em>I</em> looking for?</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Try to store some information unique to each place - maybe a section from a menu at a food place, or credentials for the dentist. Models don't always have to be the same, but they do need a "baseline" of similarity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="exercise2">Modeling Movies!</h3>

    	<h3 id="exercise3">Modeling People - Exercise 2</h3>
        <p>In this exercise you'll figure out how to model a person.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a file, call it users.json</li>
            <li>In that file, create a blank array, like this: <code>[ ]</code></li>
            <li>In that array, create several empty objects. Example:</li>
        </ul>
        <pre>
[
    {
        property: "value",
        property2: ["array", "of", "strings"],
        attribute: 27,
        thing: [24, 36, "47", "mixed array!"]
        sub_objects: [{name: "example", of: "subobjects"}, {remember: "Objects can", go: "in arrays too."}]
    },
    {
        objects: "Don't all have to have the same properties."
    }
]
</pre>
    <ul>
        <li>You'll be creating two users modeled after actual people.</li>
        <li>We want for them to both have usernames, passwords (you can store them as plain text for this exercise.)</li>
        <li>Other attributes are up to you.</li>
        <li>We're going to model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oprah">Oprah Winfrey</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleanor_roosevelt">Eleanor Roosevelt</a></li>
        <li>Use their wikipedia profiles (linked) to gain some info about them (like birthdate, current age) and other trivia.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonus:</strong> Model yourself, and a friend of yours. Use real email addresses.</li>
    </ul>
