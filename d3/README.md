# Intro to D3

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://teaching-materials.org/d3).

## Course description

In this workshop, you'll learn the basics of D3.js, an exciting JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS to create interactive visualizations on the web. 

The workshop will be a mix of lectures and hands-on exercises in pairs. This workshop will be taught by [teacher, tiny bio].

### Prerequisites:

Attendees should be comfortable with HTML/CSS fundamentals (HTML tags and attributes, CSS selectors) and JavaScript fundamentals (syntax, data structures, conditionals, loops). Attendees should also have learned the DOM API (access and modication methods). That means that you either attended our HTML 101 workshop, JS 101 workshop, and JS for the Web workshop, or that you learned those concepts online.
